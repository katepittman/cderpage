		<p>The most dangerous moment in any story is the beginning.</p>
		<p>As the story opens, every ending is equally possible, every path unwalked, every question not only unanswered, but unasked.</p>
		<p>The unread story has infinite possibility. And yet the ending is already written, and though you be clever, though you be brave, there is no outwitting it.</p>
		<p>Are you brave enough to begin? If so, click <a href="../page_1/index.html">here</a>. If not, remain safe. Close the browser. No one will think any less of you.</p>
