		 <p>You scrub your hands across your eyes and push yourself back to your feet. The path takes you on a short, downhill curve, and winds around to the door of an inn. The Quill and Ink, reads the sign over the door. You smile, and enter.</p>
		<p>Inside, there is warmth, the hearty scent of food, and a group of people singing songs both off-key and bawdy.</p>
		<p>You slide seamlessly into the small community, and feel refreshed after you have shared a meal and stood a round of drinks.</p>
		<p>Eventually, you notice the singing has died down, replaced by a rapt silence. There is a knot of people wound tight around the fire, telling stories. At first, you simply listen, but then you are asked to tell a tale of your own. It is the tale, not the coin, that will pay your shelter for the night.</p>
		<p>Do you tell a story?</p>
		<p><a href="../page_9/index.html">Yes</a> or <a href="../page_4/index.html">No</a>?</p>
