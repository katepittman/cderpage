		<p>The only story you know is your own, you say, and you must continue on to know how it ends.</p> <p>You make your excuses, and stand one more round before you leave to ensure there will be no hurt feelings, and, more importantly, no knives in the back as you walk through the door.</p>
		<p>The air is crisp, and you are refreshed. The moon limns the trees in silver, and makes clear your path. You hear music, so beautiful that at first you wonder if you are dreaming. The pound of the drums speeds the pulse of your heart and the skirl of the strings pulls you through the night.</p>
		<p>By the time you reach the standing stones, you are very nearly dancing down the path. Inside the ring of stones, the dancers spin and leap, a bright chaos of form and shape, carried along by an exultation of song.</p>
		<p>You want, as you cannot remember wanting anything, to cross into the stone circle and join the dance.</p>
		<p>Do you?</p>
		<p><a href="../page_10/index.html">Yes</a> or <a href="../page_5/index.html">No</a>?</p>
