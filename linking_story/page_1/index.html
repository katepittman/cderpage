		<p>You find yourself standing in a beautiful garden. It teems with all the birds of the air, and all of the creatures of the Earth, and every good thing that grows. As you explore, you feel an incredible sense of peace and rightness, as if the garden had been created just for you.</p>
		<p>This is the place you belong. Still, you are restless and lonely. You begin to explore your surroundings. At the western edge of the garden, there is a gate.</p>
		<p>Do you walk through?</p>
		<p><a href="../page_2/index.html">Yes</a> or <a href="../page_7/index.html">No?</a></p>
